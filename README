"trough": Water trough
	A1: DI water

"tubes": 4x6 0.5 mL tube rack
	A1: GFP dna plasmid. 10 uL in 0.5 mL centrifuge tube. 
	B1: NEBuffer. 10 uL in 0.5 mL centrifgue tube. Take 5 mL. Consolidate both R.E. and Buffer.Transfer the 6 uL together to PCR tube.
	C1: BsaI restriction enzyme. 10 uL in 0.5 mL centrifuge tube. Take 1 uL.
	D1: E-gel sample loading buffer. 10 uL in 0.5 mL centrifuge tube. Take 3 uL/well (three wells, so 9 uL used total)
	A2: 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder. 10 uL in 0.5 mL centrifuge tube. Take 3 uL.

"p10-racka": 10 uL pipette tips

"p10-rackb": 200 uL pipette tips 

"mix_plate": 96-well plate

"pcr": 4x4 well openPCR machine
	A1: empty 0.2 mL PCR tube 

"trash": point 

"standard": 4-well e-gel go reader

Notes: hot glue everything down to gantry bottom

GFPdigest_Part1
===============
Transfer 34 uL from trough to PCR tube. Doing four transfers currently (3x10 uL + 1x4 uL) because I can only use a 10 uL pipette. Will be consolidated to one 34 uL transfer when can have dual pipette control and use the 200 uL pipette.

Transfer 10 uL from "tubes" A1 to "pcr" A1

Consolidate 5 mL from "tubes" B1 and 1 mL from "tubes" C1 to "pcr" A1

Mix "pcr" A1 five times

PCR
====
60 min, 37C (program = )
20 min, 65C
hold at 16C

Notes: I am currently using the OpenPCR (http://openpcr.org/). Due to severe memory limitations of the Arduino in the OpenPCR there are limits on the program size running on it. 
Instead use OpenPyCR in the terminal (https://github.com/cathalgarvey/OpenPyCR)

GFPdigest_Part2
===============
PCR ends. Currently 16 uL solution total in PCR tube (10 uL DNA + 5 uL Buffer + 5uL Restriction enzyme). 

Consolidate 7 uL of water from "trough" and 3 uL of gel ladder from "tubes" A2 to "mix_plate" A1

Distribute 5 uL in "pcr" A1 to "mix_plate" B1, C1, D1 (so move 30 uL total from "pcr" A1 to "mix_plate". 

Distribute 2 uL of water from "trough" A1 to "mix_plate" B1, C1, D1 (so move 6 uL total from "trough to "mix_plate")

Distribute 3 uL (of gel dye) from "tubes" D1 to "mix_plate" B1, C1, D1 (so move 9 uL total from "tubes" D1 to "mix_plate")

Pipette  uL of DI H20 into A1 well of 96-well plate. 

Mix A1, B1, C1, and D1 five times each.  

Transfer 10 uL in "mix_plate" A1 to "standard" A1 

Transfer 10 uL in "mix_plate" B1 to "standard" B1

Transfer 10 uL in "mix_plate" C1 to "standard" C1

Transfer 10 uL in "mix_plate" D1 to "standard" D1   

Run gel
